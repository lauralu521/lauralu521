# AP Service
AP is a shipping service that guarantees overnight delivery of packages in the continental US.The company has various hubs at major cities and airports across 
the country. Packages are received at hubs, and then shipped to intermediate 
hubs or to their final destination. 

The manager of the AP hub in Cleveland is concerned about labor costs, and is interested in determining the most effective way to schedule workers. The hub 
operates seven days a week, and the number of packages it handles varies from 
one day to another. The table below provides an estimate of the number of 
workers needed each day of the week.

Package handlers at AP are guaranteed a five-day work week with two consecutive 
days off. The base wage for the handlers is $750 per week. Workers working on 
Saturday or Sunday receive an additional $25 per day. The possible shifts and 
salaries for package handlers are:
